# Nexus Sprint AH3 - Provider Mode Flag Contract Harness

Current base: `d64cc4b1689dedae5a507e5cee89fcca321838e1`

Sprint AH3 adds documentation, fixture, and deterministic QA only. It does not load Provider Mode into Standard User runtime, render UI, retrieve provider, clinic, telehealth, pharmacy, scheduling, medical record, FHIR, prescription, location, camera, microphone, communications, transportation, health, marketplace, emergency, identity, account, or profile data, connect providers, contact providers, contact clinics, contact pharmacies, create telehealth sessions, schedule appointments, request prescription refills, access medical records, create clinical documentation, share location, activate camera or microphone, process payments, write storage, write audit events, request permissions, make live provider claims, give medical advice, diagnose, prescribe, dispatch transportation, dispatch emergency help, or execute actions.

## Added Artifacts

- `fixtures/nexus/provider-mode-feature-flags.json`
- `scripts/nexus-sprint-ah3-provider-mode-flag-contract-harness.js`

## Fixture Coverage

The fixture set covers:

- default-off state;
- flag-on visible-only local/test state;
- unsafe authority attempt;
- enabled without visible permission.

Every fixture must preserve:

- `providerModeReviewAllowed: false`;
- `providerAccessPreviewAllowed: false`;
- `providerDirectoryPreviewAllowed: false`;
- `clinicDirectoryPreviewAllowed: false`;
- `telehealthPreviewAllowed: false`;
- `pharmacyPreviewAllowed: false`;
- `schedulingPreviewAllowed: false`;
- `medicalRecordBoundaryPreviewAllowed: false`;
- `prescriptionBoundaryPreviewAllowed: false`;
- `locationBoundaryPreviewAllowed: false`;
- `cameraBoundaryPreviewAllowed: false`;
- `microphoneBoundaryPreviewAllowed: false`;
- `identityBoundaryPreviewAllowed: false`;
- `communicationsBoundaryPreviewAllowed: false`;
- `transportationBoundaryPreviewAllowed: false`;
- `emergencyBoundaryPreviewAllowed: false`;
- `providerModeRuntimeAllowed: false`;
- `liveProviderModeRuntimeAllowed: false`;
- `providerConnectorRuntimeAllowed: false`;
- `clinicConnectorRuntimeAllowed: false`;
- `telehealthConnectorRuntimeAllowed: false`;
- `pharmacyConnectorRuntimeAllowed: false`;
- `schedulingConnectorRuntimeAllowed: false`;
- `medicalRecordConnectorRuntimeAllowed: false`;
- `fhirConnectorRuntimeAllowed: false`;
- `prescriptionConnectorRuntimeAllowed: false`;
- `locationConnectorRuntimeAllowed: false`;
- `cameraConnectorRuntimeAllowed: false`;
- `microphoneConnectorRuntimeAllowed: false`;
- `communicationsConnectorRuntimeAllowed: false`;
- `transportationConnectorRuntimeAllowed: false`;
- `healthConnectorRuntimeAllowed: false`;

- `medicalRecordAccessAllowed: false`;
- `fhirAccessAllowed: false`;
- `clinicalDocumentationAllowed: false`;

- `medicalRecordsFhirRuntimeAllowed: false`;
- `medicalAdviceAllowed: false`;
- `diagnosisClaimAllowed: false`;
- `prescriptionInstructionAllowed: false`;
- `policyBypassAllowed: false`;
- `confirmationBypassAllowed: false`;
- `permissionBypassAllowed: false`;
- `firstTurnExecutionAllowed: false`;
- `laterTurnExecutionAllowed: false`;
- `standardUserProviderModeMutationAllowed: false`;
- `backendWriteAllowed: false`;
- `storageWriteAllowed: false`;
- `networkAllowed: false`;
- `auditWriteAllowed: false`;
- `executionAuthority: false`;
- `noExecution: true`.

## Runtime Boundary

The harness is a Node QA utility only. It must not be loaded by:

- `public/index.html`;
- `public/app.js`;
- `server.js`.

The harness must not include DOM, storage, network, provider handoff, permissions, navigation, native bridge, workflow, health execution, telehealth execution, pharmacy execution, medical record access, provider contact, clinic contact, pharmacy contact, scheduling, location, camera, microphone, payment, transportation dispatch, emergency, or execution APIs.

## Relationship To Sprint AH2

Sprint AH2 defines the default-off Provider Mode feature flag contract. Sprint AH3 proves the contract with deterministic fixtures, including unsafe authority attempts that must normalize back to no-execution.
